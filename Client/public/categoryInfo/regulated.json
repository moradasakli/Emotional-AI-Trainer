  "content1": "The Regulated Element encompasses the idea of self-regulation, both internally with respect to biological needs and emotional responses, and externally by utilizing the environment for intentional self-regulation. Responses to physiological signals can influence habits and behaviors. Through integration of the body and mind, somatic experiences can modulate distressing emotions and influence the autonomic nervous system's signals. Consistently regulating environments provide opportunities for protection against the physiological response to stress.",
